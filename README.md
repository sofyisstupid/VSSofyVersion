### yeah yeah yeah, I know.
You might be like,

## Sofy, Where the fuck is the source code??

And my response to that my dear friendo is, I'm not giving it to you or anyone.

## Why?

Most mods don't put their source code public even when it's just a few changes here and there.


## What is this Repository then?

Well, This is just to store little values that need to be updated online.

For example, If the "ModVersion.txt" file changes from V1 to V2 then your copy of VS sofy will say "Hey bro, update your game."

### That's all I have to say for now.

If you're wanting to contact me for whatever reason, you can contact me through my discord: sofy5359
